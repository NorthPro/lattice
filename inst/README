======================


The overall internal structure of the lattice library has changed
considerably in verion 0.3, in particular making it far more readable
and debuggable. However, this also means that some code which had
worked with the earlier version might now fail. (This is just a
discalimer, there are no known instances.)

New Features:
============

 o (Almost) full support for the `key' argument for drawing legends

 o Support for log scales

 o levelplot (but no contourplot. In particular, the contour = T option
   in levelplot does not work)

 o tmd now works on the output from qq 

 o panel function names can now be quoted strings

 o scales and its x and y components can now be just a character
   string like "free" or "sliced", i.e., the relation tag can be
   omitted. 

 o extension to the `type' argument in panel.xyplot and
   panel.superpose to allow stair-like and histogram-like plots
   (type="s" and "h" in plot), as well as loess smooths (using
   the loess.smooth function in the modreg library). Also, more
   than one of these options can now be used concurrently. This
   allows, for example, a grouped plot where a grouping variable
   can be used to fit separate loess curves along with the scatter
   for each group. See example(xyplot)

 o wrappers around grid functions with API-s of traditional graphics
   functions to help port existing S-Plus Trellis code. See below for
   details.

 o changes in print.trellis to allow mixing of Lattice and usual R 
   graphics. See below for details.


Porting S-Plus Trellis code to Lattice
======================================

One of the basic problems in porting existing Trellis code to R is the
unusability of the base R functions like lines and points inside panel
functions. To help make the changes more transparently, lattice now
includes several wrappers around grid functions that provide an API
similar to the corresponding base R functions. The list currently
includes lpoints, llines, ltext and lsegments.

Using Lattice and base R graphics concurrently
==============================================

Grid/Lattice graphics should now mix (almost?) seamlessly


Still Missing
=============

 o contourplot, wireframe, cloud (partially implemented) and of course,
   piechart

 o Some components of scale (I haven't found a full list, so
   can't say exactly which are missing)

 o Fonts 

 o axis labels badly implemented, no checking for overlaps.
