	* R/common.R: The changes in lattice 0.5-0.6 added some code that
	gave bad results when some panels had all NA's. That hopefully
	fixed. 

	* R/miscellaneous.R: lplot.xy used to call grid.text instead of
	grid.points when pch was a character. Fixed this.

	* R/print.trellis.R: draw.key failed when lines component had
	type='b', because of a missing pch. Fixed this.

	* R/levelplot.R: Minor fix related to changes in grid.
	

2002-12-06  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/settings.R: added warnings and error messages in
	trellis.par.get/set when no active device, and when value in
	trellis.par.set is not a list.

	* R/trellis.par.get.Rd: rewrote some things

2002-11-16  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/common.R: added arguments have.log and logbase to
	calculateAxisComponents()

	* R/print.trellis.R: made changes to use above changes



2002-10-28  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R: Hmm, lots of changes made without any log entries. Should be
	more careful ! Anyway, renamed inst/README to inst/Changes, and
	added a brief overview of changes in lattice 0.6 . Also made some
	documentation updates. Changed version to 0.6-6, ready to upload. 

2002-01-10  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R: Too many changes to list, mainly in print.trellis and
	documentation. 

2001-08-08  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/levelplot.R: Implemented preliminary levelplot (no contourplot
	though). Also a version of cloud, though no support yet for nice
	axes/arrows and stuff (does allow panel.superpose though). Again, 
	no plans of implementing wireframe in the near future.

	* R/common.R:
	Added support for 3d formulae in latticeParseFormula

2001-07-26  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/Lattice.Rd: Included llines, lpoints etc for easy adaptation
	of existing Trellis code. qq() changed to as it should be, should
	now work with tmd().

2001-07-12  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/Lattice.Rd: Major redesigning of existing functions. Mainly 
	by collecting common code into a few functions and hence 
	making individual functions easier to handle. Code should now
	be fairly readable. Also, more or less good support for log scales
	and key (I hope). Not much checking done yet, there may be bugs.
	Documentation might be out of step at places.

2001-05-06  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/tmd.R: Name changed from trellis to Lattice. Prelilminary
	changes to account for change of Lattice to Grid made. New
	functions rfs, oneway, qq (not final), qqmath, tmd, plot.shingle,
	update.trellis. Documentation more or less clean.

2001-04-19  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/trellis.R: lots of changes. Introduced trellis objects.
	Print method for trellis objects. Implementation now includes 
	barchart, bwplot, densityplot, dtplot, histogram, stripplot,
	xyplot, splom and parallel (and excludes piechart(will probably 
	remain that way), qqmath, qq, timeplot(?), contourplot,
	levelplot, wireframe and cloud). Cleanup, documentation etc.

2001-03-22  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/trellis.R: added splom and some brief documentation for splom

2001-03-02  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/trellis.R: dtplot (dotplot) implemented. Probably has lots of bugs.
	Some documentation, including example for dtplot (same as usual dotplot example).

2001-03-02  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/trellis.R: updated bwplot (with the new layout structure)
