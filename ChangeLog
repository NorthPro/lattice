	* R: Too many changes to list, mainly in print.trellis and
	documentation. 

2001-08-08  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/levelplot.R: Implemented preliminary levelplot (no contourplot
	though). Also a version of cloud, though no support yet for nice
	axes/arrows and stuff (does allow panel.superpose though). Again, 
	no plans of implementing wireframe in the near future.

	* R/common.R:
	Added support for 3d formulae in latticeParseFormula

2001-07-26  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/Lattice.Rd: Included llines, lpoints etc for easy adaptation
	of existing Trellis code. qq() changed to as it should be, should
	now work with tmd().

2001-07-12  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/Lattice.Rd: Major redesigning of existing functions. Mainly 
	by collecting common code into a few functions and hence 
	making individual functions easier to handle. Code should now
	be fairly readable. Also, more or less good support for log scales
	and key (I hope). Not much checking done yet, there may be bugs.
	Documentation might be out of step at places.

2001-05-06  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/tmd.R: Name changed from trellis to Lattice. Prelilminary
	changes to account for change of Lattice to Grid made. New
	functions rfs, oneway, qq (not final), qqmath, tmd, plot.shingle,
	update.trellis. Documentation more or less clean.

2001-04-19  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/trellis.R: lots of changes. Introduced trellis objects.
	Print method for trellis objects. Implementation now includes 
	barchart, bwplot, densityplot, dtplot, histogram, stripplot,
	xyplot, splom and parallel (and excludes piechart(will probably 
	remain that way), qqmath, qq, timeplot(?), contourplot,
	levelplot, wireframe and cloud). Cleanup, documentation etc.

2001-03-22  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/trellis.R: added splom and some brief documentation for splom

2001-03-02  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/trellis.R: dtplot (dotplot) implemented. Probably has lots of bugs.
	Some documentation, including example for dtplot (same as usual dotplot example).

2001-03-02  Deepayan Sarkar  <deepayan@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/trellis.R: updated bwplot (with the new layout structure)
